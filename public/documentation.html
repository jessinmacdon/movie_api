    This is a well-designed REST API and
    architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The REST API
    is accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods
    (CRUD) is used to retrieve data from our database which is then stored that data in a non-relational
    way.<br>
    Users are be able to use the myFlix application whenever they like
    to read information about different movies or update their user information, for instance, their
    list of “Favorite Movies.”.<br>
    The myFlix application itself is responsive and
    can therefore be used anywhere and on any device, giving all users the same experience.<br>
    As a movie enthusiasts myself, I want to be able to access information about different movies,
    directors, and genres. The server-side of the myFlix application will ensure they have access
    to this information, that their requests can be processed, and that all necessary data can be
    stored.
